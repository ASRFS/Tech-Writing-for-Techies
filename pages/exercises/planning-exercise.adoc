Plan how you would write instructions on _putting on a jacket_ for someone who doesn't already know how to do it, such as a small child (who can somehow already read), someone from a culture that doesn't have jackets, or even an alien (as long as it's roughly human-shaped).

Some things to consider in planning:

== The reader

* What is the reader's goal?
* What does the reader know about jackets?
* What does the reader _not_ know about jackets? What of that will they need to know to put one on?
* What mental models do you use when you talk about jackets? Is your reader likely to share those models?

== The document

* What is the purpose of this document?
* What scope limitations might there be on this topic?
* What is the reader's starting point?
* What is the reader's end point? When are they "done"?
* Are there other documents you might refer them to?
* Is there specialized vocabulary you want to use in this document?
