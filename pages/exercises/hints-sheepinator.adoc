== Notes from a subject matter expert

. Most weapons in this context _do_ use ammunition, which must be collected or it will run out. It's therefore notable that this one doesn't run out of ammo.
. When the user pulls the trigger, an orange beam of light comes out of the muzzle of the weapon. After a time, this orange beam turns things into sheep.
. The progress bar displays on the user's screen. This is known functionality and does not need to be explained.
. Lock-on mode is available on many weapons. It is known functionality and does not need to be explained.
