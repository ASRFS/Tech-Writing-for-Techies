*Instructions for a person from a culture that does not wear jackets.*

== The reader

What is the reader's goal?:: To be able to put on a jacket correctly before leaving the house.
What does the reader know about jackets?:: That they're clothing, that they go on the upper body outside of other clothes.
What does the reader _not_ know about jackets?:: What your choice of jacket says about you, the mechanical process of putting one on, the terms for the parts of a jacket.
What of that will they need to know to put one on?:: The mechanical process and the terminology.
What mental models do you use when you talk about jackets?:: Why to wear them: modesty, fashion, warmth. Putting one on using the model of putting on a shirt.
Is your reader likely to share those models?:: I'm going to assume that the reader's culture also wears clothing for modesty, fashion, and warmth. So I can talk about how jackets address those goals. I'm going to assume that their culture does _not_ include shirt-like clothing. (For example, all clothing there is wrapped or draped and they don't have separate sleeves).

== The document

What is the purpose of this document?:: To be able to put on a jacket.
What scope limitations might there be on this topic?:: What kind of jacket to put on (I'm going to assume a long-sleeved zip-up jacket with a hood.)
What is the reader's starting point?:: The reader is otherwise dressed to go out. They are already holding a jacket that fits them and is in a state to be worn (it's clean, the zipper is not broken, etc.)
What is the reader's end point? When are they "done"?:: The reader is ready to walk out of the door with the jacket on correctly and configured for the current weather (zipped or not, hood up or down).
Are there other documents you might refer them to?:: The weather forecast, to decide how the jacket should be configured.
Is there specialized vocabulary you want to use in this document?:: Names for parts of the garment, such as sleeve, cuff, collar, zipper, lining, hood, drawstring.
