Using the draft you wrote in the link:./writing-exercise.html[last exercise], spend *no more than 15 minutes* editing your instructions on _putting on a jacket_ for your chosen audience.

If you're not satisfied with your draft (for instance, if the writing technique you tried just didn't work), you can edit a link:./sa-writing.html[sample first draft] instead.
