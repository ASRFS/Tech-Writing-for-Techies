Using the planning work you did for the link:./planning-exercise.html[planning exercise], spend *no more than 15 minutes* writing instructions on _putting on a jacket_ for your chosen audience.

If you're not satisfied with your planning, you can use the link:./sa-planning.html[planning sample answer] as a basis instead.

*Write using a link:./01-02-writing.html#_writing_methods[method] that you don't usually use.* This is your chance to try something new. Maybe it won't work, but maybe you'll find a whole new way of writing.
