= Text Formatting and Punctuation

== Emphasis

An italic _word_, and an italic _phrase of text_.

== Strong

A bold *word*, and a bold *phrase of text*.

== Code

"`Wait!`" Indigo plucked a small vial from her desk's top drawer
and held it toward us.
The vial's label read: `E=mc^2^`; the `E` represents _energy_,
but also pure _genius!_

== Superscript and Subscript

Well the H~2~O formula written on their whiteboard could be part
of a shopping list, but I don't think the local bodega sells
E=mc^2^.

== Quotation Marks and Apostrophes

"`What kind of charm?`" Lazarus asked.
"`An odoriferous one or a mineral one?`"

Kizmet shrugged.
"`The note from Olaf's desk says '`wormwood and licorice,`'
but these could be normal groceries for werewolves.`"
