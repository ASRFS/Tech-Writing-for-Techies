// ---- EXPLANATION ----
Now all of the sentences in the paragraph are about the same thing: ships leaving a system with a Babylon station. But they don't hang together. The events the sentences describe don't seem to have any relationship to each other.

They're like a pile of bricks, not a wall. There's no mortar, no _connection_. Without that, each sentence raises contextual questions that the paragraph doesn't answer.

* _How_ does the duty commander monitor the ships?
* _Why_ do ships make an exit declaration?
* _When_ does the jump gate controller open the gate?

When you answer these questions, the sentences in the paragraph stop being a collection of random events that happen to take place in roughly the same place and time. They become a process, with reasons for the individual steps and a flow of control.
