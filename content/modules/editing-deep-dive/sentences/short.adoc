// ---- EXPLANATION ----
Short sentences (less than 20 words) are better than long sentences.

Short sentences are easier to _read_.:: They impose less cognitive load on readers. Long sentences take more attention and can slow readers down. An if they lose their place, there's more to reread.
Short sentences are easier to _understand_.:: They tend to have simpler grammar. It's easier to misread a long sentence.
Short sentences are easier to _write_.:: At almost any level of English skill, a short sentence with simple grammar is easier to write than a long one.
