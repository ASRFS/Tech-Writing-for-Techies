This is a classic first-draft sentence. It's very long, full of extra words, and wanders from topic to topic. Everything in it is important, but the reader has to work to get that important stuff out. How can you fix this?

First, identify the separate facts in the sentence. They're marked in with different colors below.

[.blue]#Given that sentences are the primary building blocks of documentation#, *it is important that each of them conveys only one single fact*, [.green]#stated as simply as possible#, [.purple]#so that the reader can grasp each item completely before going on to the next#.

// end::slide[]

// ---- EXPLANATION 2 ----
Next, cut out any extra words, so that each fact stands out in its sentence. Rephrase unclear or wordy text. This step is really an exercise in word choice.
