The 1:1 relationship goes the other way as well. *Each concept should be referred to by only one word.* Unlike in other kinds of writing, varying your word choice isn't interesting; it's link:./00-01-key-concepts.html#_cognitive_load[cognitive load].

*THE PROBLEM*

[.ornamental]
image::file.png["Image of a file folder"]

The sentences above mention a *folder* and a *file*. But both words refer to the same thing: _a piece of stiff brown paper folded in half, into which you put other pieces of paper_.

If you use two words, some of your readers will think you mean two things, and start trying to find a distinction that isn't there. Picture your reader staring at a stationery cupboard, looking for something that can be described as a *file* but isn't what they already know is a *folder*.

*THE SOLUTION*

. Choose one word to use for each idea or concept. In this case, *folder*.
. Write this down on your word list.
. Apply it throughout the document.

NOTE: When you're deciding which concepts are different enough to need their own words, think about the reader. If reader won't see a difference, use the same word. So if a reader doesn't need to know what tree is an oak and what is a pine, call them all trees.
