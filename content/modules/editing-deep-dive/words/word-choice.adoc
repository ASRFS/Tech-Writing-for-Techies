// ---- EXPLANATION ----

It almost goes without saying that words are the building blocks of technical writing.

Choose your words well, and your readers will find the documentation easy to understand. They won't even notice how clear and well-defined its ideas are, how smoothly it teaches new vocabulary and concepts, or how _pleasant_ it is to read.

Choose your words badly, and your readers will be confused, tired and frustrated, without quite knowing why.
