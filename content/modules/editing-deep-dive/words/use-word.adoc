*THE PROBLEM*

Every time you use a technical term, you're imposing cognitive load on any readers who don't already know it. Ask yourself if it's worth it.

Technical terms can become a kind of geek gang sign, used to show off the writer's expertise. You may feel that it builds reader trust in you. But a better way to show that expertise is to explain a difficult thing clearly.

*THE SOLUTION*

Only use rare and specific technical terms when they _make a useful distinction_ that more common words don't. If you must use them:

. Introduce it properly (see <<_introducing_new_terms>>).
. Write it down on your word list.
. Apply it throughout the document.
. If you have a glossary, add the word to it.

NOTE: An example is the definition of the term *thesaurus* in the section on <<_one_word_one_meaning>>. THe footnote defines it as _A website where you can enter a word and find other words that mean the same thing_. There's a techncial term for _a word that means the same thing as another word_. It's a *synonym*. But using that word would have meant teaching it to readers, although it's never used again in the course. That's wasted energy. Cognitive load.
