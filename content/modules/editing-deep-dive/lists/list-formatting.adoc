// ---- EXPLANATION ----
// tag::html[]

The third part of emphasizing content differences between list items is the most superficial: formatting the items consistently. How you format the items depends on your style guide. If you don't have one, this is a good approach:

*Capitalization*: Start each list item with a capital letter. Otherwise, if some words are naturally capitalized and some aren't, the list looks ragged.

*Punctuation*:

* If list items are basically sentence-shaped, finish each item with a period.
* If list items are single words or groups of words, don't put periods at the ends of any of them.

// ---- EXPLAINING THE NEGATIVE CASE ----

Do _not_ punctuate your list items like they're a sentence falling down the page like a waterfall.

This kind of list is hard to maintain well. Every time you add to, delete from, or rearrange it, you have to remember to update the punctuation.


NOTE: _Consistency_ is more important than any of these rules. If an existing document punctuates lists one way, keep doing that, even if it breaks the rules. Most readers aren't aware of the rules. But they may notice if your lists look wildly different.
