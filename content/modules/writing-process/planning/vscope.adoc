// ---- EXPLANATION ----
One way to avoid writing too much is to understand what documents already exist, and how they relate to what you need to write. There may be a stack of documents on a given system, ranging from a high-level description for business users to very low-level detailed content aimed at developers.

Know what documents are above and below the one you're working on. For each of them, be aware of:

* _Their_ scope, so what you write integrates smoothly with them. You don't want to leave a gap for your readers to fall into, or duplicate content that you then have to maintain.
* The mental models and vocabulary they use. Even if you use different ones, you need to be compatible with them
* Where they are, so you can link to them. Think about permissions here: are they available to your audience?

CAUTION: Each "layer" of the documentation on your subject, including the one you write, should be able to stand on its own. You can _refer to another document for extra information_ but don't _depend on it for necessary information_.
