You have to choose the _scope_ of your documentation. How much information should you put in there?

The rule is to *only include information that supports your reader's goals.* The challenge is to know what that means for your documentation.

You can't just shrug and put everything in just to be safe. Otherwise your document will be as thick as the New York phone book. This creates two problems:

* Your readers will have trouble finding what they need.
* You've just created a pile of technical debt, because everything you wrote has to be maintained.

But don't include too little:

* If there are gaps in what you've written, some of your readers will find themselves without any help.
* Your document should be a coherent whole, rather than a collection of links the reader has to piece together.

Trim your document down to _what your readers need to know_. The precise "cut here" line depends on the document, but don't skip things like mental models and troubleshooting for when things go wrong.
