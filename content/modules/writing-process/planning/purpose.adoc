// ---- EXPLANATION ----
What is the purpose of your document? Can you state it in one sentence?

* What are you explaining?
* To whom?
* So they can do what?

You don't have to include it the documentation, but keep it in mind as you work. It's your North Star, your insurance against scope creep or topic drift.

For instance: _This course teaches the basics of technical writing to people in different technical roles so that they can write better._
