// ---- EXPLANATION ----
You also need to think about your audience in terms of their knowledge. There are three kinds of knowledge to consider.

What they don't know:: You know your subject. Unfortunately, it can be easy to forget how it feels not to know it. But as a writer, you need to put yourself in the shoes of your audience, to meet them where they are. That includes remembering and respecting their _lack of knowledge_. (That lack is what makes them your audience, after all.)

What they should know:: Also known as _assumed knowledge_. This is the fundamental knowledge they need to have, or they're not your audience. For example, the programming language you're working with.

What you hope they know:: Limited, clearly-defined things that are specific to your topic. If they don't know it, they can look it up fairly easily. Things like:

* Domain-specific knowledge
* Specialized vocabulary or special meanings of common terms
* Standards and conventions

You don't have to _explain_ these things. Provide good search terms or links to reliable sources and let your readers find them on their own.


[NOTE]
====
Your documentation won't teach your readers everything. You'll have to draw the line between what you plan to teach them and what you won't.

For instance:

* Things that are confidential/trade secrets.
* Things that are not relevant to their goals.
* Hidden details, such as implementation details or the inner workings of algorithms.
