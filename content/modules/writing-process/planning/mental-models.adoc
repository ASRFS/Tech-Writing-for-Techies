// ---- EXPLANATION ----
People can only take in information if they have a framework to organize it. This framework is called a _mental model_.

Whatever you're documenting, its existence started with someone thinking about a problem in a particular way. How they thought about that problem &mdash; their mental model &mdash; determined how they solved it, what abstractions, analogies, design patterns, and approaches they used.

Your reader needs to share that mental model or your documentation won't make any sense to them.

.What does it look like when your reader doesn't share your mental model?

When my younger brother was about 4 years old, he loved riding in elevators. As a treat, we took him to a building whose elevators had glass walls. We rode one several times. Afterwards, we asked him, "What was special about that elevator?"

We expected him to say something about glass, but what he said was, "It goes up and down."

His mental model of an elevator was something like _A box that you go into and press a button. You feel funny for a little while, then the doors open and you're somewhere different._ He didn't understand how the different places related to each other, or how the elevator connected them.

Imagine explaining that your elevator got _stuck between floors_ to him.

Your audience may be in the same situation with what you're documenting. Ensure that somewhere early on in the documentation (in a "Key Concepts" section or an introductory paragraph), you give them enough of a mental model to understand everything else you want to teach them.
