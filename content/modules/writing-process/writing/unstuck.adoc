// ---- EXPLANATION ----
There's a technical term for getting stuck writing: writer's block. What can you do if you're blocked?

Work on a different section of your document:: Many of us learned this one in exam preparation: if you're stuck on one question, go on to another and come back later.
Change your writing method:: Even if you never, ever, ever use a different method than your preferred one, what have you got to lose? If free writing is letting you down, do a little outlining or make a mind map.
Change your medium:: Try explaining what you're trying to say out loud. Grab a pen and some paper and try handwriting it.
Try writing in another language:: (if you know one, obviously). Whether you're switching to your native language or away from it, shifting languages changes how you think.
Change your location:: If you're working from home, go sit in a different room. If you're in the office, see if there's a conference room free. Moving to new surroundings can give you permission to start afresh.
Take a break and move:: Get up and walk around. Go outside for a few minutes. Grab a cup of the beverage of your choice.

All of these strategies do the same thing: they break a pattern that's no longer working. If your relationship with the work is toxic, break that relationship and form a new one.

And remember: *if your writing is terrible, that doesn't mean you're doing it wrong.* You can fix it at the editing stage.
