Even experienced writers sometimes forget that the first draft can be terrible. [.strike]#If# When you find yourself muttering as you write, _This is amazingly awful_, keep writing. It's a completely natural feeling.

The alternative is to spend an hour polishing the first half of of the first sentence. That's not a good use of your time, and it gives you no way forward. You can't fix what you haven't written.

IMPORTANT: The point of a first draft is _not_ to create something you're happy with. The point is to create something you can fix.
