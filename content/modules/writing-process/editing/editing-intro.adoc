There's an old saying about how to carve an elephant. You take a block of stone and cut away anything that doesn't look like an elephant.

The editing phase of writing is much the same: you start with a large chunk of text and cut away everything you don't need for the final version. It's hard work, but it can produce something worthwhile.


NOTE:  This topic gives you a brief overview of the editing process. The link:./00-00-course-overview.html[Editing Deep-Dive module] contains more detailed information on improving your first draft.
