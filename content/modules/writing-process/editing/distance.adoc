// ---- EXPLANATION ----
The first thing to do when it's time to edit is _something completely different_.

When you write something, you form a connection to it. You need to break that connection. Otherwise you'll only see what you _meant_ to write, not what's actually there. You can't fix what you can't see.

Some ways to get that distance:

* Give it time. Set the writing aside overnight. Or at least eat something or take a walk.
* Change the medium. Print it out, read it aloud, look at it on your phone, change the font.
* Read it backwards. Start with the conclusion and read toward the introduction.

(You may notice that there's some overlap with the suggestions for link:./01-02-writing.html#_getting_unstuck[getting unstuck while writing]. Both are ways of breaking an emotional connection that's in the way of what you want to do.)
