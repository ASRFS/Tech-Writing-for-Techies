Time to clean up:

[%step]
* Repeated words you've repeated.
* Words that missed.

. Inconsistencies.

* Sentences you meant to finish but
// end::slide[]

// ---- EXPLANATION ----

*There are two things you should remember about proofreading:*

* Plan to do several passes, because every change you make can add typos.
* Proofreading should be the last thing you do before calling your document finished.
* Even then, you're probably going to miss things. Take comfort that what you end up with is better than what you started with.
