// ---- EXPLANATION ----
Separating the writing and editing steps means you get to use weasels to write the difficult things.

Yes, weasels.

. In the *writing* stage, you can express your ideas vaguely. You're free to use what Wikipedia calls "weasel words", such as _maybe_, _sort of_, and _under some circumstances_. You can lean on hand-waving words like _this_ and _it_ that don't point back to anything in particular. And when you're writing something that may be controversial, vagueness gives you a place to hide.
. Then in the *editing* stage, you go from vagueness to clarity. Release the weasels from your text into the wild and make things clear for your readers:
** Take a stand about what's true. No more _maybes_.
** If things aren't simple, explain the complexity. Under _what_ circumstances, exactly?
** Be specific: make it clear what every _this_ and _it_ refers to.

Both steps are challenging, but neither is as hard as writing something both true and clear in one go.
