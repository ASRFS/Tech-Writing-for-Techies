// ---- EXPLANATION ----
When are you done with the editing process?

Unfortunately, editing is like testing: you never finish. You just run out of time and stop.

If time is limited, you can stretch the testing/editing analogy further by using _risk-based editing_. Focus on the areas where there is a high *probability* of getting things wrong, or where mistakes would have a high *impact*.

In any case, remember that whatever editing you _do_ manage to do improves the final product.
