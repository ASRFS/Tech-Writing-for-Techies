// ---- EXPLANATION ----
A lot of rewriting is breaking up huge sentences into bite-sized pieces.

Many people write very long sentences in their first drafts. And that's fine! First drafts are for content, not style.

But if your sentences wander all over the place, going from one subject to another, your readers have to work harder to follow them. (And that's link:./00-01-key-concepts.html#_cognitive_load[cognitive load].) So you need to split them up.

The goal is that *each sentence should contain only one fact*. If there are two facts, make them two sentences. That way your reader can absorb the information one manageable chunk at a time.


NOTE: You can read more about this in the link:./02-02-sentences.html[sentences] topic in the Editing deep-dive module.
