// ---- EXPLANATION ----
The biggest part of the editing phase is _rewriting_: taking the same content and expressing it in a different, clearer way.

Rewriting your first draft can be really difficult. Rereading the text, you may think your writing is terrible. But remember that that was the intention: first write, then fix. You're fine!

(And if it's really terrible, that means that anything you do will probably improve it! I tell myself this often.)
