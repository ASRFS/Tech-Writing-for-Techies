Like sentences, first-draft paragraphs often go on and on, wandering from one topic to another. But in the final version, *each paragraph should relate to only one idea.*

Build each paragraph like you'd build a brick wall:

. Choose the components that fit. +
The first step in building a wall is to make sure you have bricks of the same type. In the same way, the first step in constructing a paragraph is to make sure you have sentences about the same idea. Set aside any bricks or sentences that don't fit.

. Arrange and connect them. +
A pile of bricks is not a wall, and a collection of sentences is not a paragraph. The separate components have to be connected to form a coherent whole. The mortar of a paragraph is the connections between its sentences. This can be simple sentence order, or connective words and phrases.

Then repeat the process with the sentences you set aside. If they have a place in your document, it's because they have their own separate idea or ideas.
