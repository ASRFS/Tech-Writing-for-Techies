// ---- EXPLANATION ----
The course is made up of *modules*. Each module covers a specific subject.

Each module contains a set of *topics*, discussions of specific aspects of the module subject. The topics are available as html pages for self-study and as slide decks for teaching purposes. If you're using the slide decks, the self-study pages can serve as speaker notes.

There are also exercises for some of the topics. These are designed to reinforce the topic. They come with sample answers or hints.

Writing in English:: Many people who write in English aren't very confident about it. What are the commonest mistakes, and how can you fix them? And what to do about those annoying words _the, a, an_ if your native language doesn't have them?
