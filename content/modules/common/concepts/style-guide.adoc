// ---- EXPLANATION ----
Writing style guides are tools to make your writing consistent with the people you work with.
That way the documentation doesn't have distracting changes in voice and style.
Style guides explain how to write, how to format different types of text, and even how to spell and punctuate common technical terms (wifi? WiFi? Wi-Fi?).

This course follows to the https://developers.google.com/style/highlights[Google Developer Documentation Style Guide]. The guide itself has more details and examples.

Ask if your organization/project has a style guide. If it does, and that guide disagrees with anything in this course, follow the guide rather than the course. If your organization/project doesn't have a style guide, it's time to adopt one.
