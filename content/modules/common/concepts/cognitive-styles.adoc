// ---- EXPLANATION ----
Cognitive styles are the reason you can't reduce everyone's extraneous cognitive load to zero. Some people absorb verbal information best and just want you to _tell them_ what they need to know. Others learn through pictures and diagrams, and find words tiring.

IKEA instructions are the perfect litmus test: some people find them delightfully clear. Others can't make head or tail of them.

Both kinds of people are _first class citizens_ of your information. Where possible, find ways to cater to both of them. This course focuses on technical _writing_ but you should also include visual elements in your documentation. Note that the images shouldn't just be decoration. They have to strike to the heart of what you're explaining.
