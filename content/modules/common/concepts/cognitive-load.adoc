Cognitive load is probably the most important concept in technical writing. It's basically the work our readers have to do to learn from what we've written.

// ---- EXPLANATION ----

As technical writers, there's nothing we can do about the two bottom layers of the diagram. They're determined by the subject we're discussing and the nature of the human brain.  We can only control the top level, *extraneous cognitive load*: the load imposed by _how we present information_.

Most technical writing rules are just well-tried ways of reducing extraneous cognitive load as much as possible, for as many people as possible. Because people are different, you can't make things easy for everyone. There is no perfect solution, just a lot of judgment calls.

(You can, however, make it _difficult_ for everyone. Don't.)
