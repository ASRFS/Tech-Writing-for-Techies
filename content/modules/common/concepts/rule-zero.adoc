// ---- EXPLANATION ----
So if good technical writing is writing that communicates, can we just throw away all the rules?

Not so fast.

Writing rules exist for a reason. You'll find that writing that communicates to your readers is more likely to follow the rules than than to break them. But there _are_ times when the rules get in the way. (Some of them are covered in this course.)

If you have to choose between communicating with your audience and sticking to the rules, break the rules. They're really just guidelines.
