There are some words that, when they come before a noun, take the place of any articles. The two main classes of them are:

* *Possessives*: Words that indicate who the thing belongs to. _**My** Precious_, _your ring_, _Bilbo's sword_, etc.
* *Demonstratives*: _**Th**is gold_, _that diamond_, _these rubies_. This makes sense, as [.blue]#*the*# is descended from demonstratives.
