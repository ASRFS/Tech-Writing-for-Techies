Sadly, following a flowchart won't always save you from the weirdness of English articles. There are exceptions to the rules.^1^ These exceptions fall into two basic categories:

* Extra words before the noun that take the place of [.blue]#*the*#, [.blue]#*a*#, and [.blue]#*an*#. &larr; *MyTh*
* Classes of noun that just don't take articles at all. &larr; *PLANS*

Time to discuss them.

[.small]#1. There are also exceptions to the exceptions. And so on.#
