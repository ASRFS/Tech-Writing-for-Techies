// ---- EXPLANATION ----
Countable nouns are:

* Things that can be counted &larr; *tribble*
* A countable amount of an uncountable thing &larr; *coffee* in the sense of *cup of coffee*

You can test whether a noun is countable by seeing if it has a singular and a plural (*tribble*/*tribbles*, *coffee*/*coffees*)^1^. Or you can try counting it.

[.small]#1. English does have a few nouns that use the same word for singular and plural, such as _fish_ and _sheep_. But they're still countable. Sheep, in particular, are famously countable, though the process is famously boring.#
