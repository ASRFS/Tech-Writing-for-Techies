Instead of the complex interplay of subtle rules, this lesson uses a flowchart to guide you to the appropriate article: _the_, _a_, _an_, or nothing at all. The text that follows discusses each decision point in turn.

This is an imperfect solution, but it's more usable than an instinct that you don't have or rules you can't understand.

Note that although *MyTh? PLANS?* is at the top, the discussion of that decision point comes last. These are exceptions to the rules, and they'll make more sense once you know the rules themselves.
