// ---- EXPLANATION ----
Sometimes there's more than one of the same thing in scope. But then you choose one and point it out to your audience. It's like walking up to a car in a parking lot and saying "this is my car".

Once it's been introduced, it becomes specific, because it's _the one that's been pointed out_.

Common ways that things go from nonspecific to specific in writing:

* Referring to them with _a_ immediately beforehand: _A man walked down the street_. No the audience knows which man, so you can go on with _The man doesn't speak the local language_.
* Starting the discussion of them with phrases such as _there is_ or _there are_: _There is a house in New Orleans. The house has a bad reputation._
