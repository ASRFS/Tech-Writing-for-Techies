The first test is specificity. Something is _specific_ when the audience knows which one you're talking about. To put it another way, _can the reader point to it?_ If they can, and if it doesn't fall into the exceptions at the top of the flowchart, you can use [.blue]#*the*#.

OK, but you're not a mind reader! How do you know what your audience knows?

Like everything in language, specificity is a shared understanding between the writer and the reader. You can use a few tests to determine whether your reader should be able to point to what you're writing about.
