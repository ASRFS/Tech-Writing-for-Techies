If the definite article [.blue]#*the*# is _this/these_ or _that/those_ minus *location*, then [.blue]#*a*# and [.blue]#*an*# are [.blue]#*the*# without *specificity*. This is why they're called __in__definite articles.

OK, you ask, but what's left?

First of all, there's *quantity*: _a_ and _an_ are always singular. But more significanty, the indefinite article tells you that *the speaker _can't_ point at what they're talking about*, and you're not expected to either.

Fittingly, many European languages use an  unstressed version of the word _one_ to mean [.blue]#*a*#.
