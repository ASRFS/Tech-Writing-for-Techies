If you counted your non-specific item and you got past _one_, you've established that:

* Its non-specific nature means you can't use [.blue]#*the*#.
* The fact that there's more than one means you can't use words derived from _one_ such as [.blue]#*a*# or [.blue]#*an*#.

This means that you don't use an article.

NOTE: In the messy way of languages, this is the same as if the noun was uncountable. For example, if you're talking about "irises", but can't explain _which_ irises you're talking about, how is that different than discussing the abstract, uncountable idea of irises?

If you only have one non-specific item, go on to the last test.
