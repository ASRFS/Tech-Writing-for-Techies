// ---- EXPLANATION ----

What does it mean if something is _not_ specific?

It doesn't mean it doesn't exist, or that your audience isn't aware of it.

It means that your audience can't differentiate it from similar things, pick it out of a crowd, or tell which items are in or out of its group. In other words, they can't point to it or draw a line around it. But they can still talk about it.
