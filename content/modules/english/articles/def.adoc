Generally speaking, languages turned words for _this_ and _that_ into their versions of the definite article [.blue]#*the*#:

* Latin-based languages adapted _that/those_ (_ille, illa, illum_)
* Descendants of proto-Germanic used _this/these_ (_se, seo, þæt_)

_This/these_ and _that/those_ are called _demonstratives_.
Demonstratives tell the audience three things:

* That the speaker is referring to a *specific* thing (or several specific things).
* What *quantitiy* the speaker is talking about: one thing or more than one.
* What the *location* of the specific thing(s) is relative to the speaker (near or far).

Turning a demonstrative into [.blue]#*the*# strips away information about *location* and (in English) *quantity*. All that's left is that there's something (or things) *specific*, something the speaker can point to, at least metaphorically.
