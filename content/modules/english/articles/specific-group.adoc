// ---- EXPLANATION ----
A _group_ of things can also be specific.

You can determine if a group is specific by thinking about what's in them and what's out of it. Instead of pointing at one thing, you're drawing a circle around a defined group of things. If your reader can tell the difference between what's in and what's out of the group, then the group as a whole is specific.

_She set up her chess pieces. *The* figurines felt cool in her hands._
_The coffin contained dirt from Dracula's castle. *The* dirt smelled like bitter almonds._

Ask yourself whether your readers can identify:

* What is _in_ the group you're talking about:
** _Her chess pieces_
** _Dirt from Dracula's castle_
* What otherwise similar items are _not in_ the group:
** _Her opponent's chess pieces_
** _Dirt from the garden center_

If your readers can, then it's a specific group and you can use [.blue]#*the*# about the items in it.
