// ---- EXPLANATION  1 ----

In technical writing, things are often named for their relationship to other things. So an _**API** key_ is a key that allows you to use an API.

When the relationship between the things is many to one, how do you create the name? If there's a set of names of categories in your code, are they _category names_ or _categories names_? If a planet killer kills more than one planet, shouldn't it be a _planets killer_?

Logic would dictate that the name would reflect the proportions of the relationship.

Unfortunately, English isn't always logical. No matter how many planets the thing kills, you still have to use the singular.

A good way to remember it is that many apples go into a single apple pie. But it's still an *apple* pie, not an *apples* pie.
