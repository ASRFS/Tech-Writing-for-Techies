// ---- EXPLANATION  1 ----
English has too many kinds of present tense. Some of them are fancier than others.

The *present progressive* (_is --ing_) is pretty fancy. It tells the reader that something is going on, and probably will keep going on.

This fancy present is not usually used in technical documentation. Any time you see it, you can improve the sentence by changing it to the *simple present* (_--s_):

=== Simple presents are best

// tag::html[]

====
The monster [.red]#*is lurking*# in the garbage masher. +
The monster [.blue]#*lurks*# in the garbage masher.
====

// end::slide[]

*WHEN TO BREAK THIS [.strike]#RULE# GUIDELINE*

There is one case when the present progressive is necessary: after _while_, used to describe a period of time.

=== Simple presents are (usually) best

====
Don't go into the garbage masher [.blue]#_while_ the monster *is lurking* there.#.

// end::slide[]

[NOTE]

This is different than link:./02-02-sentences.html#_write_active_sentences[_passive verbs_], which are *is/are lurk_ed_*.
